/**
 * Scoring weights.
 *
 * The spec declares `ScoredRecipe.score` but never defines its terms
 * (Technical Spec §4.1), and the AI playbook says to write this by
 * hand. These weights are reasoned, not fitted — revisit after the Aug 18-22
 * user-testing round.
 *
 * Bucketing is by missing count, so score only orders recipes WITHIN a bucket.
 *
 * Coverage dominates because it is the user's actual question. The skip penalty
 * outweighs a marginal coverage gain because an explicit skip is the only
 * negative signal the user volunteers; a disliked recipe never reaches scoring
 * at all, since `decide` eliminates it outright.
