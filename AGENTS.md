# HomeChef agent bootstrap

This is the repository discovery entry point for coding agents. The canonical
operating system is `docs/agentic/OPERATING_SYSTEM.md`; read it before
substantial work.

## Hard boundary

Do not add or restore repository hooks, workflows, scripts, or environment
entries that post to or edit external communication or project-management
systems. External connector sessions are managed outside this repository.

## Start here

1. Read `docs/agentic/OPERATING_SYSTEM.md`.
2. Read `docs/00_PRODUCT_DIRECTION.md`.
3. Read the relevant document in `docs/`.
4. Inspect the existing diff before editing.
5. Run the relevant checks before handoff.
